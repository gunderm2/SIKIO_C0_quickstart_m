   PURPOSE:
   This is essentially a blink sketch intended to demonstrate the basics of programming an
   Android with the Processing development environment to interact with hardware via a IOIO.
   This example blinks an LED on the IOIO board and blinks a rectangle on the Android screen.
   This example shows how the main Processing file (in this case, SIKIO_C0_quickstart.pde)
   and the IOIO_Tab.pde file work and interact. The main .pde file controls the Android
   user interface and the IOIO_Tab.pde controls the IOIO board, and the two interact
   through the use of global variables, in this case the 'lightON' variable.
   
   HARDWARE:
   This is an example that doesn't require anything other than your Android and a IOIO,
   connected by a USB cable, and a way to power your IOIO through the JST connector.
   
   OPERATION:
   Connect your Android to the computer with a USB cable, and click the 'Run on Device' 
   button in the Processing IDE. Once Processing displays 'Sketch launched on the device'
   dialogue, connect your Android phone to your powered IOIO device with a USB cable.
   Every half second, the IOIO loop sends a command to the IOIO to turn the onboard
   LED on or off. It toggles the global variable 'lightON' at that time before going
   to back to sleep. This global variable is read within the main draw() loop and a black 
   or white box is drawn depending on the state of the LED.
